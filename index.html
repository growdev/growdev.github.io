<h1>👋 Hi, I'm Daniel Espinoza.</h1>

<h2>About me</h2>

<p>I'm a web developer and business owner currently living in San Antonio, Texas.</p>

<h3>What I'm Doing Right Now</h3>

    <li>Hanging out in San Antonio, Texas with my wife and kids 🌎</li>
    <li>Leading projects at my WooCommerce agency <a href='https://growdevelopment.com'>Grow Development</a> 🖥</li>

</ul>

<h2>My Work</h2>

<h3>- Grow Development -</h3

<p>I run a WooCommerce consultancy at <a href="https://growdevelopment.com">Grow Development</a> which is made up of myself and a small team of highly skilled WooCommerce developers.</p>
<p>We work primarily with companies running WooCommerce and WooCommerce Subscriptions sites selling over $1MM annually.</p>
<p>I founded Grow Development in 2008.</p>

<h3>- Shop Plugins -</h3>
<p>I build commercial plugins for WooCommerce at <a href="https://shopplugins.com/">Shop Plugins.</a> I've been running this shop since 2015.</p>

<h3>- Monitorific -</h3>
<p>I'm currently building <a href="https://monitorific.com/">Monitorific</a>. Monitorific is an automated checkout testing tool for WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads. This is a saas built on the [Laravel Framework](https://laravel.com/).</p>
<p>I hope to launch this in April 2022!</p>

<h2>Colophon</h2>
<p>This site used to be hosted on WordPress, but because I deal with WordPress sites all day managing on this site felt like work. I switched to using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and I can now use 
    GitHub's web based browser to manage the site with ease.</p>
<p>Eventually I'll spin up a WP site and bring back some of my older content and blog posts.</p>
