<h3>Shop Plugins</h3>
<p>I build commercial plugins for WooCommerce at <a href="https://shopplugins.com/">Shop Plugins.</a> I've been running this shop since 2015.</p>

<h3>Monitorific</h3>
<p>I'm currently building <a href="https://monitorific.com/">Monitorific</a>. Monitorific is an automated checkout testing tool for WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads. This is a saas built on the <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel Framework</a>.</p>


<h2>Contact</h2>

<p>If you want to get in touch with me <a href="https://twitter.com/growdev/">send me a tweet</a> or fill out <a href="https://growdevelopment.com/contact/">this form</a>.</p>

<h2>Built with</h2>
<p>This site used to be hosted on WordPress, but because I deal with WordPress sites all day which made managing this site feel like work. I switched to using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> and I can now use 
    GitHub's web based browser to manage the site with ease.</p>
<p>Eventually I'll spin up a WP site and bring back some of my older content and blog posts.</p>
